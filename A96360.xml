            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>With theſe Spectacles you may ſee cleerly, that Great ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſh Ships, mann'd with Land-men, are not ſerviceable for this State.</p>
            <p>That fleet of <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ships, was much greater in Number, Tonnes, Men and Ordnance, then <hi>Englands</hi> Navie is, or ever was, but Maugre their Greatneſſe, and Number.

            <p>I ſay in a few houres, they ſo confounded the Great <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Ships, that ſcarce one of ten Returned into <hi>Spayne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this Great and memorable Fight, ſome of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ships were Burnt, ſome were Sunck, and ſome were taken. The reſt runne a-ſhore, or runne away; <note place="margin">This Ship wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>If you compare the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Armado, which came into <hi>England,</hi> in the yeare 1639.

               <item>This laſt Report is very remarkable, it is of a greater Concernment then all the Paſſages in this booke; By it you may know, that <hi>Englands</hi> Navie is Contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, and muſt come behind.</item>
               <item>That the great Ships which were prepared at <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Chatham,</hi> to ayd Sir <hi>Iohn Penington,</hi> were ſo long Wind-bound, that the Fight was ended three dayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they came into the <hi>Downes.</hi> This miſchiefe is uſuall, and therefore very conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable.

               <item>That when the laſt great Fight began, Thirty of the <hi>Hollanders</hi> were to Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet, which in my opinion was a high Preſumption.

               <item>The Concluſion of theſe Obſervotions is, That <hi>Van Tromp</hi> violated his Promiſe in falling upon <hi>Oquendoes</hi> Fleet in the Kings Road.

                  <hi>Tueſday,</hi> 17.</note> This day there came a Packet from the Lord Admirall to our Admirall, wherein was mentioned that the <hi>Dutch</hi> Embaſſador, upon a letter that he had received from Admirall <hi>Tromp,</hi> made a complaint of our Admirall, that he ſhould ſay unto Capt. <hi>Cats</hi> Rere-admirall of the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> and ſome other Captaines, that hee ſent abord unto Sir <hi>Iohn,</hi> to deſire leave that ſome of his Ships might ride to the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of the <hi>Spanyards,</hi> as is before mentioned the 11.<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day, That hee would ingage his head that the <hi>ſpaniſh</hi> ſhips could not nor ſhould not goe to the Northwards in the night; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwaies he would have ſent ſhips to the Northward to look unto them, the which did trouble our Admirall exceedingly. And the next day in the morning, hee ſent Captain <hi>Richard Fielding,</hi> Capt. <hi>Robert Slingsby,</hi> Capt. <hi>Edward Popham,</hi> and my ſelfe, abord of the <hi>Hollands</hi> Admirall, to juſtifie that our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall did never ingage himſelfe unto Capt. <hi>Cats</hi> and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Captain, that the <hi>Spanyards</hi> ſhould not goe out to the Northwards in the night; for wee did all of us heare all the Conference that paſt between our Admirall and Capt. <hi>Cats,</hi> and we gave him to underſtand that our Admirall did not take it well from him, that hee ſhould write ſuch falſities of him unto their Embaſſadour. To the which Admirall <hi>Tromp</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Wedneſd.</hi> 18.</note> that he had writ nothing but what his Rere-admirall Capt. <hi>Cats</hi> had related unto him; which was, that Sir <hi>Iohn Penington</hi> did ſay, that hee would ingage his head that the <hi>ſpaniſh</hi> ſhips could not nor ſhould not goe out in the Night. But Capt. <hi>Cats</hi> being there preſent, denied in ſecret unto us
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:117587:14"/>that he never mentioned, ſhould not, but that his Admirall had added that unto the meſſage that he brought him, and as I conceived thereby the better to cleer himſelf from his neglect of ſending ſome ſhips to Ride in the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nells to the Northwards as aforeſaid, But <hi>Cats</hi> durſt not openly deny it, fort hen he ſhould have given his Admirall the lye: ſo the fault was wholly laid upon Capt. <hi>Cats,</hi> with the which anſwer we returned. Afterward I was ſent again ſingle aboard of Admirall <hi>Tromp</hi> as it were to give him a viſit by my ſelf, and to have an hour or twoconference together, to which he had divers times invited me familiarly &amp; called me brother, hoping thereby to get ſomething out of him being ſingle more then we could when there was more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with him. But I could not learn from him, that he had as yet received any other inſtructions from the States then his generall inſtructions; albeit that he had divers times writ un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them for ſome other inſtructions, what he ſhould doe in this particular buſineſſe; But as yet could hear of any, only that they did leave all to his diſcretion, which did much trouble him (for ſaith he) if ſo be that the <hi>Spanyards</hi> ſhould begin to ſtir from thence, if he did not begin with them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were wholly out of the Road when they came a broad many of them if it were a gail of winde would eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape them; and again on the contrary if ſo be that he ſhould begin with them in the Road, then he doubted that we would take part with the <hi>Spanyards,</hi> whereby a breach might be made between his Majeſtie and the States of <hi>Molland,</hi> which would not eaſily be reconciled, <note place="margin">18. <hi>Wendſd.</hi>
               </note> if ſo be that the States ſhould allow and ſupport him in what he ſhould do in this kinde.</p>
            <p>But he doubted that rather then the States would have any difference with his Majeſty they would leave him to the mercy of the King, and then ſaid he it may be that I may be hanged for my good ſervice. Wherefore he reſolved not to begin nor
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:117587:15"/>do any thing in the Road unleſſe they gave him warrant for it; alſo in our diſcourſe he demanded of me how many ſhips we had of the Kings and Marchant men that we had taken up in the Road? I anſwered that we were four or five and twenty Sayle: well ſaid he, you are ſo many, and the <hi>Spanyards</hi> are 50 Sayle, and we are (ſaid he) of our Fleet 50 Sayle, I would you were all enemies, and had freedome to fight in the Road: to which I replied, that if the <hi>Spanyards</hi> were all man'd with Engliſh men, and I had the command of them, we would beat them out of the Sea; unto which he replied you do miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take me, I do mean that I would that your Fleet were away, and ſo many <hi>Spanyards</hi> in your place, mane'd with their own Nation, and then he would not fear to buckle with them all.</p>
            <p>After this I had order to take up all the ſmall <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſhips that had Ordnance in the Road, and to give them or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to put our pendants. One half I appointed for the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall and the other half for the Vice-admiralls ſquadron, the winde towards night at S. S. E. and S.

            <p>All that after-noone and the next morning I ſearched for theſe Veſſells, and went abord of all the ſmall Veſſels in the Road, but could not find any Souldiers abord of any of them, and likewiſe forwarned all of them in the Kings name that they ſhould not take in any <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Souldiers to tranſport them for <hi>Flanders,</hi> and amongſt theſe Veſſels by inquiry, I was certified that <hi>Thomas Gilbert,</hi> and <hi>Hugh Lawes,</hi>

But at our firſt comming abord before we could deliver our meſſage, he circumvented us, and ſaid do you ſee thoſe fellows, meaning the Captains of thoſe two ſhips, how they have Birth them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves I think the divell is in them for I cannot get them to follow my directions as they ſhould; and thereupon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſent to warrants and cauſed them two remove, <note place="margin">21.

               <p>Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> called a Councell of all his Captains and Maſters, to adviſe whether it were not fitting for us to wey with our Fleet, <note place="margin">Wedneſday</note> and to birth our ſelves to windwards of thoſe <hi>Hollanders</hi> that did ride without us, to the w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> we all agreed, if ſo be that the <hi>Hollanders</hi> did not remove according to promiſe, at which meeting, our Admirall did encourage all his Capt. and Mrs. to ſhew themſelves men, in the ayding of that party that ſhould be aſſaulted, in his Majeſties Chamber, as this Road is called, the which they all promiſed faithfully to performe, and ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted every one to his owne Ship, it being likely to blow hard, the wind towards night at E. and by N.</p>
               <p>At day light the wind being at E.

I willed him to go to the Northward or to the Southward of us, or to the Leewards of us, and not to ride in the wind of us, the w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> he promiſed ſhould preſently be performed; and put out his Blood Colours upon the <hi>Poope,</hi> which was a ſigne for the other ſhips to wey their Anchors, and they removed pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently; but after my meſſage was delivered, the Vice-admirall
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:117587:23"/>who calleth me Couſen, demanded wherefore the <hi>Spanyards</hi> did ſtill delay their time of going forth of the road; I anſwer'd him that in the firſt place the wind was contrary. Secondly, they had ſent to <hi>London</hi> for Powder and other proviſion, and until that came they could not ſtirre, alſo I demanded of him whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they had any farther directions then they had formerly, he anſwered me that he knew not what the Admirall had, and ſeeing that I could not learne any thing from him, I tooke leave, and when I came abord related his Anſwer to our Admirall, all his Ships weyed, and new birtht themſelves, and ſome of them Anchored right to windwards of us, <note place="margin">

The next morning before noone, a Spaniſh Commander came with a Letter from the Lord Warden, to deſire our Admirall to ſend ſome Ships in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Dover</hi> Road, to ſecure one of the Spaniſh Galeons that had bin run a-ſhore between <hi>Dover</hi> Caſtle and the Peere neare un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Dover.</hi> Iuſt at that inſtant we deſcribed the <hi>Hollanders</hi> fleet comming about the South foreland, but the Admirall had no
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:117587:30"/>Colours abroad, they came all unto Anchor right thwart of <hi>Kings-downe,</hi> the Admirall came headmoſt and ſaluted us, and ſo did all his Fleet one after another. But we did not anſwer him one Piece of Ordnance; when we deſeryed them, a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell was called, and Order given that all our Ships ſhould be preſently made ready to ſet ſayle. Alſo it was Ordered, that Captain <hi>Rich. Fielding,</hi> Capt. <hi>Cartwright,</hi> and my ſelfe, ſhould goe to the <hi>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ollands</hi> Admirall, to inquire what his Intention was, that hee did returne againe into his Majeſties Road, unto whom he had given ſo high an affront. But the wind blowing ſo hard and the tyde againſt us, wee could not get abord of him that night.</p>
               <p>At day light the wind not ſo boyſterous but continuing ſtill weſterly, wee got abord of them, and demanded of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall <hi>Tromp</hi> his intention as aboveſaid, who anſwered that hee had no other Intent for his comming in there, but to Repaire ſome defects: that his Fleet had ſuſtained in the fight with the <hi>Spanyards,</hi> as to fiſh ſome of their Maſts and yards that were ſhot, and alſo to ſtop ſome ſhot-holes between wind and water. Then we demanded of him, what hurt he had ſuſtained in the fight, and what damage he had done to his Enemies. He anſwered, praiſed be God, he had received no great damage amongſt his Fleet, and that hee had taken 9. or 10. Sayle of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Galeons and hoped of more taken by ſome ſhips of his, and had fired the <hi>Portugals</hi> Admirall as is formerly mentioned, and how that <hi>Don Lopus de Oſſa</hi> the Commander of that ſhip, and his Company did ſhew themſelves brave Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, for her lower Ordnance continued playing vpon them when the fire was at their Top-maſts head; alſo he ſaid that they ſaved of the <hi>Spanyards</hi> that lept overbord nere 70 men, who did certify him, that <hi>Don Lopus,</hi> albeit he was a man of above 70 years of age, and had his arme ſhot of in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the fight, yet hee continued above vpon the upper deek, Incouraging of his men to fight it out unto the laſt, vntill
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:117587:31"/>the fire ſeazed vpon him, whoſe death he did much lament. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo he ſaid, that the prime Admirall <hi>Don Anthony do Oquendo,</hi> never Cut his Mainſayle nor let fall his Sprit ſayle, but conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued by his conſort <hi>Don Lopus</hi> ſo long as he could ſuccor him, but when he ſee him fired, and paſt hopes of Reliefe, he made all the Saile that he could and with the Admirall of <hi>Donkerke</hi> &amp; divers other ſhips of his fleet, he ran away to the weſtwards.</p>
               <p>Before midnight the wind Weſtered ſo, that ſo farre as they were a head of the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> ſo much they were to windwards of them; yet the <hi>Hollanders</hi> plyed too and fro all the night, expecting, that on the morrow, by ſhift of wind, they might recover them.</p>
               <p>But in the Morning not one of them were in ſight ſo that he thought that they had got <hi>Donkirk.</hi> But ſaid hee, I hope ere long to Burne both him and all his Fleet, as they ride in the Road under the Splinter. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt other diſcourſe with him, I did Inquire for my Friend Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <hi>Forran</hi> a French Captaine formerly mentioned, and how he had behaved himſelfe in the fight, he anſwered me, that he was a ſtout man of Warre, and ſaid that if ſo be that all his Captains had bin ſuch as he was, they might have done more then they did.</p>
               <p>But hee imployed him about a buſineſſe of Conſequence, otherwayes he had been in the Road. Which was as J was afterward informed, to take the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Galeon that rode in <hi>Dover</hi> Road. The which Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice he performed; for the next day there came Complaints unto our Admirall, that ſhe was taken out of the Road in the night and carried away, which was impoſſible for us to prevent; For the <hi>Hollands</hi> Fleet did ride in the mid-way betweene the <hi>Spanyard</hi> and our Fleet.</p>
               <p>After which hee demanded of vs, what was the ſtate of all the <hi>Span<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards</hi> that were run aſhore vpon the ſtrand, we anſwered that the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt part of them were Sunke and ſplitt, ſo that they would come to the Country People according as he had deſtined them at his firſt Coming hither, and that the <hi>hamborgers</hi> and <hi>Lubikers</hi> had poſſeſſion of ther ſhips diſcharged their Souldiers and for the reſt they were ſould, and poſſeſt by Engliſh men, which was Related by his Order before all his Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains that were abord with him which were at leaſt 20 or 30 of them vpon which bee ſaid that hee was glad that the Engliſh had ſo much Benefit by them, and alſo, that thereby hee was free from being In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged, to fetch them from the ſhore, and from amongſt our fleet, as ſome of his other Captaines had made a motion to have him doe; for ſaith he I might thereby have given his Majeſtie, and the whole Fleet
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:117587:31"/>of England more diſtaſt, then with all that he had formerly done, the which he would be very loath to doe, But if ſo be that the Engliſh had not had poſſeſſion of them, By the Inſtigation of the reſt of his Fleet, he muſt have bin forced to put it to a hazard.</p>
               <p>To which we anſwered, that our ſtrength was now increaſt, and we did expect more before many houres; ſo that hee would find it a worſe bought then all, which proved accordingly; for before Night there came into the <hi>Downes</hi> foure of his Majeſties Ships of the ſecond Rank and one of the third Ranke, and Six of the beſt <hi>ſtraights</hi> Merchants Ships that were in the River of <hi>Thames.</hi> The wind after-noone at N. N.W. After our comming abord to Sir <hi>John,</hi> and relating what we had heard and ſayd, hee ſent Captain <hi>Slinsby</hi> and my ſelfe aſhore unto the Spaniſh Vice-Admirall <hi>Don Andrewes de Caſtro,</hi> To certifie him of all what wee had heard from the <hi>Hollanders</hi> and how that wee had Informed them that all his Ships that were a-ſloat, were in the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> By which meanes, wee had diverted them from their Reſolutions, which was, to have come and taken them all away with them, which would have coſt him a Bloody noſe, at leaſt. Alſo we certified him, that our Admirall was ſorry to heare of the baſe Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of the Country people towards him and his Men, the which was come to his Majeſties knowledge; for the Earle of <hi>Northumberland</hi> b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d Intimated ſo much in a Packet to our Admirall, and that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty would have him to take care that they ſhould not ſuffer any wrong by any of his Subjects. The which our Admirall would endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to performe, ſo farre forth as his Power would reach, which was no further then the Road, but hee had no Command upon the Land, alſo J gave him notice that J had Order from our Admirall, to goe abord of his Ship and the reſt of the Wacks upon the ſhore, to looke after them; that no man ſhould Imbezell any thing from them, and to forbid all men whatſoever, except it were ſuch as were hyred to by his Subſtitutes, upon peyne of his Majeſties diſpleaſure, not to take any thing out of thoſe <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ships a-ground; for the which and all former, hee returned moſt hearty thankes to our Admirall.</p>
               <p>In the Morning the wind was at N. by W. a ſtaffe gale, before day a Packet came from the Lord Admirall, and by a order therein I was Sent a ſhore to the Spaniſh Vice-admirall to give him to underſtand, that our Admirall had Order to Convoy his Souldiers for <hi>Flanders,</hi> if he did ſhip them in <hi>Engliſh</hi> Bottoms, he Anſwered that hee did expect ſome Veſſels from <hi>Donkerk</hi> for to tranſport them; But if they came not
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:117587:32"/>he did intend to provide veſſels at <hi>Dover,</hi> and then he would thankfully Imbrace our Admiralls Convoy. About noone all the <hi>Hollands</hi> fleet ſet Sayle and run to the Weſtwards about the Foreland, and then <hi>Don Andrewes</hi> gave Order to all his ſhips that were a-float and rid neare the ſhore to goe Ride farther of. At night the wind Weſtward and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved very fayre wether all night, and all the next day afternoone all the <hi>Hollands</hi> fleet came Open of the Forland abord, and bore about on the backſide of the <hi>Goodwin,</hi> and ſtood away moſt of them towards the Eaſt of <hi>Holland</hi> and the reſt towards <hi>Flanders.</hi> At night Captaine <hi>Hall</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned from his Majeſtie, who had certified his Majeſtie of all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedigns which had hapned betwixt the <hi>Spanyards</hi> and the <hi>Hollanders.</hi> Next morning came a Complaint unto our Admirall that divers of the Boats of his Fleet had bin abord of the wracks, and had Imbezelled and taken out their Proviſions; upon which our Admirall gave Order to Capt. <hi>Hall,</hi> Capt. <hi>Stradling,</hi> Capt. <hi>Ramsby,</hi> Capt. <hi>Cartwright,</hi> and my ſelfe, &amp;c. To goe abord of all the Fleet, and to ſearch them, having with us two Spaniſh Captaines likewiſe to accompany us. In our ſearch wee found more or leſſe abord of every Ship, ſome of the Span<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards proviſions, the which was carried by the ſayd Ships-boats abord of the St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> and the <hi>Crowne,</hi> two of the Spaniſh ſhips. But for the Anchors and Cables that wee had taken up, that they Cut away in the Road, thoſe wee detayned abord untill farther Order from the Lord Admirall. But wee would not ſuffer the <hi>Deal</hi> Pilots to meddle with any one of the Anchors. At Night there came a Packet from the Lord Admirall, that wee ſhould not ſuffer any one to meddle with an Anchor or Wrack, if they were ſo neare the ſhore, as that a Horſeman riding into the Sea at low water could reach it with his Launce or Speare, and that wee ſhould not meddle with any thing within that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit; for that Priviledge did belong to the Lord Warden, or to the Lords of the Manner. Likewiſe there came another Packet, for the Ships that were lately ſent downe, to returne to <hi>Chatham,</hi> and the Ships which were ſent from <hi>London</hi> to returne to <hi>London;</hi> onely the Winter guard, ſo there was none left but the Winter guard.</p>
               <p>The next day, Captaine <hi>Slingsby</hi> carried over the Spaniſh Maſter <hi>Delda Campo;</hi> And the ſame day, there came over Eight <hi>Dunkirke</hi> Sloopes, who carried away foure hundred Souldiers, that ſet ſayle in the after-noone.</p>
               <p>The next day, all the Ships had their Warrants to take the firſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of wind and wether to returne from whence they came.</p>
